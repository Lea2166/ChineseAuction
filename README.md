# ChineseAuction
This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end web application designed to facilitate and manage a Chinese Auction event. The system is built with a clear separation of concerns, divided into three specialized repositories: a dynamic frontend, a robust backend API, and a dedicated testing suite.
